= Uniswap Hooks

A https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/uniswap-hooks[Solidity library] for secure and modular hooks for https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/overview[Uniswap v4]. This library includes:

* Base implementations for custom accounting, asynchronous swaps, and custom curves
* Fee-related implementations for management and enforcement
* Ready-to-use hooks for general use cases, like sandwich protection
* Utilities and libraries for hook development

== Overview

[[install]]
=== Installation

The library can only be installed with Foundry using gitmodules for now. Support for Hardhat is coming soon.

==== Foundry (git)

```console
$ forge install OpenZeppelin/uniswap-hooks
```

NOTE: Make sure to add `@openzeppelin/uniswap-hooks/=lib/uniswap-hooks/src/` in `remappings.txt`.

[[usage]]
=== Usage

Once installed, you can use the contracts in the library by importing them:

[source,solidity]
----
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

import {BaseDynamicFee, IPoolManager, PoolKey} from "src/fee/BaseDynamicFee.sol";
import {Ownable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

/**
 * @dev A hook that allows the owner to dynamically update the LP fee.
 */
contract DynamicLPFeeHook is BaseDynamicFee, Ownable {
    uint24 public fee;

    constructor(IPoolManager _poolManager) BaseDynamicFee(_poolManager) Ownable(msg.sender) {}

    /**
     * @inheritdoc BaseDynamicFee
     */
    function _getFee(PoolKey calldata) internal view override returns (uint24) {
        return fee;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Sets the LP fee, denominated in hundredths of a bip.
     */
    function setFee(uint24 _fee) external onlyOwner {
        fee = _fee;
    }
}
----

To keep your system secure, you should **always** use the installed code as-is, and neither copy-paste it from online sources, nor modify it yourself. The library is designed so that only the contracts and functions you use are deployed, so you don't need to worry about it needlessly increasing gas costs.
